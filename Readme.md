  <tr>
    <td><b>Input folder</b>:</td>
    <td> > Contains all movie-files/ images in sub-folders for one project/ experiment <br/>
         > Choose file folder and click <b> Open Folder </b>

   </tr>
  <tr>
     <td><b>Output folder</b>: </td>
     <td>
        > Is automatically created : Input + "_Results" <br/> 
        > Or click <b> Change output </b>  to define a desired output folder <br/>
        > Contains all configuration files, raw data, plots and excel sheets (see above) 
     </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b> Frames per second: </b> </td>
    <td> > Should be > 15 for optimal results for optimal results, <br/>
          but 10 f/s can be sufficient </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
     <td> <b> Skip images: </b> </td>
     <td> > Default 0, (0 - 10 possible) <br/>
          > 1 = Every second frame is skipped  <br/>
          > Might accelerate the analysis as the number of images is cut in half <br/>
          > Use only if frame rate is high enough! 
          </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
     <td> <b> Pixel size: </b> </td>
     <td> > Please check the size of a pixel at your microscope; <br/>
            in your metadata; or use a scale and ImageJ/Fiji to determine your pixel size [Âµm] <br/>

          > Relative values will still apply  <br/>
          </td>
  </tr>

     <td> <b> Overwrite data: </b> </td>
     <td> > If data needs to be re-analyzed <br/>
          > If unselected all analyzed hearts will be skipped in the project folder
          </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
     <td> <b> Acquisition mode: </b> </td>
     <td> > Fluorescence (chamber-specific): Fluorescent heart is required <br/>
            and 10x magnification is desired  <br/>
          > Bright field (only heartbeat): The script is optimized for bright field movies /series <br/> 
            of frames of whole zebrafish in sagittal position (eyes included)
          </td>
  </tr>
    
</table>


#### Start program ####

By clicking ```Start```, the method ```StartConfigs.run_program``` is executed which iteratively <br/>
executes ```heart_beat_GUI_only_one_fish_multiprocessing.py``` <br/> 
or ```heart_beat_GUI_only_one_fish_multiprocessing.py``` <br/>  
for each zebrafish and combines all Excel sheets once all zebrafish have been analyzed. <br/>  
In the bright field acquisition mode, all zebrafish will be analyzed automatically. <br/> 
This will take a while, e.g., 20 to 30 min for 40 zebrafish depending on the computer performance.  
<br/>


### Step 3) Rotate heart for fluorescent acquisition mode ###

Rotate the heart for chamber-specific fluorescent acquisition mode using the slider to position ventricle   <br/>
at the top and atrium at the bottom. Click ```OK``` to continue. <br/> 
You can orientate the fish in another direction.  <br/> 
However, the tool will later automatically re-rotate the video for analysis!

![Rotate](Screenshots_tutorial/2_rotate_heart_small.jpeg)

### Step 4) Define atrium and ventricle ###

To distinguish between background and heart define 1) atrium and 2) ventricle area by ```Drag-and-Draw```.
Click ```OK``` to start the analysis of all frames / images. <br/>
Best results yields a rough selection around respective heart chambers (see image below).
<br/> Make sure that the border encloses all parts of the atrium!

![define_heart_areas](Screenshots_tutorial/3_define_heart_areas_small.jpeg)

The first processed image is shown after the complete analysis.
Press  ```Yes``` to show heartbeat curves. <br/>

The number of analyzed fish hearts is shown in the top left corner (here: 1/2 analyzed)

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <td><b>freq: </b></td>
    <td> > Frequency / rate of heartbeats derived from fitted sine function (red dotted line) </td>
   </tr>
  <tr>
     <td><b>fft_freq: </b> </td>
     <td>
        > Frequency / rate of heartbeats derived from fast fourier transformation (FFT) <br/>
     </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b> phase shift: </b> </td>
    <td> > Shift between atrium and ventricle sine function <br/>
         > A very small or very high phase shift can be a sign of arrhythmia / AV-block
            but 10 f/s can be sufficient </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
     <td> <b> arrhythmia score: </b> </td>
     <td> > The lower this value, the more regular the heartbeat. <br/> 
          > A value >0.7 is a sign of arrhythmia <br/>
          </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
     <td> <b> av-block score: </b> </td>
     <td> > The absolute difference of all frequencies (freq and fft_freq) between atrium and ventricle <br/>
          > A value >0.5 is a sign for a conduction defect or atrial/ ventricle tachycardia or bradycardia
          </td>
  </tr> 
  
</table>



### Excel sheet for all heart movies analyzed ###

Once all fish hearts have been analyzed you can choose to open the summary Excel sheet for all fish

## Troubleshooting and FAQ ##

### Installation issues ###
* If ```install_pyHeart4Fish.py``` does not run to the end or the desktop icon is missing, <br/>
install the package ```pyshortcuts``` first by typing ```pip install pyshortcuts``` in Windows console <br/>
and run again ```install_pyHeart4Fish.py```
* You might also install all packages in ```requirements.txt``` separately from 
(see [GitHub/ToReinberger/pyHeart4Fish](https://github.com/ToReinberger/pyHeart4Fish)  
by typing ```pip install <NAME_OF_PACKAGE>``` in Windows console


### Analysis error ###
* Make sure that the background fluorescence is as low as possible  
* In step 3 and 4, make sure you correctly select the atrium (in most case less bright part of the fish),<br/>
otherwise the background threshold is set incorrectly 
* If the heart hasn't been identified correctly, please try to re-define atrium and ventricle area, 
e.g., by enlarging the area
* If progress bar is on hold, please click ```Next Fish``` as an error has occurred
